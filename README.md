# ***Accenture-Client-Retention-Growth-Analytics***

### 📖 ***Introduction***: A Data-Driven Approach to Problem-Solving
After gaining expertise in data analytics, I wanted to apply my skills to solve a real-world business challenge. To achieve this, I turned to ChatGPT for insights into pressing issues faced by Accenture. Among the suggested challenges, client retention and growth stood out as a critical factor for sustained success.

Since real business data was not available, I took the initiative to create a dummy dataset reflecting industry trends, engagement metrics, and retention factors. This allowed me to simulate real-world scenarios, analyze client churn patterns, and uncover actionable insights to enhance customer loyalty and business growth.

At Accenture, client retention and service expansion are crucial for sustained growth. This report provides an in-depth analysis of client churn, renewal likelihood, and key influencers impacting retention. By integrating these insights, we can develop strategic initiatives to improve customer satisfaction, optimize engagement, and drive business growth.
